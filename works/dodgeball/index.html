        <p class="pt-4">When I'm not work, I can probably be found playing dodgeball. We all (or most of us) probably played dodgeball as a kid. I know I did. I played again a little more in High School and then was introduced to the adult dodgeball league known as the New Orleans Dodgeball Association (NODA) back in the summer of 2015. It didn't take long for me to approach the then owner and ask if I could offer my services to help with their website. Fastforward to present day, and I am now a part owner of NODA and in charge of all things web and design (as well as some non-NODA dodgeball related things). Seen below are some things I've done.</p>
