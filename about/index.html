        <p>I have more of a traditional art background, as I was in the Talented Art Program through middle and high school.
            After taking a few photoshop courses high school, I decided to take my skills to the University of New Orleans.
            I graduated with a degree in Fine Arts with a concentration in Digital Art where we used programs such as Photoshop,
            Illustrator, and After Effects to create art.
        </p>

        <p>Through college, I worked at Office Depot where I floated between the technology sales area and Copy, Print, &amp; Design
            department. In the Copy, Print, &amp; Design area, I was essentially the sole person responsible for helping customers
            design their business cards, clean up the art for their business, format their prints, as well as give creative
            advice to achieve the final product they were looking for.
        </p>

        <p>After college and Office Depot, I worked at Laser Tag of Metairie where I was both one of the Assistant Managers
            as well as the Graphic Designer responsible for making all promotional graphics for the building. These graphics
            ranged from the signs showing our hours of operation posted on the window, to our digital menu boards and print
            menus for the caf√© area. I also maintained the website and kept it up-to-date with graphics and information.
        </p>

        <p>Currently, I work at PoolCorp in Covington, Louisiana as a Web Designer as well as a part-owner of the New Orleans
            Dodgeball Association where I am also in charge of the web and graphic design.
