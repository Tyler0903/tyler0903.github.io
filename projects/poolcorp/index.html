        <h1>PoolCorp Web</h1>
        <p>I currently work as a Web Administrator/Designer at PoolCorp in Covington, Louisiana where I've been working on the web/marketing team for about
            2 years now. Since becoming a member of the team, I have been a core member in the redesign for our three biggest sites (seen below) as well
            as updating many other domains we control.</p>

        <p>A large part of all of our sites are esuring complete responsiveness to allow comfortable viewing on all devices as well as ADA compliance.</p>

        <p>*The below sites are listed from most recent to oldest.</p>
